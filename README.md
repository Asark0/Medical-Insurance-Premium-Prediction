# Medical-Insurance-Premium-Prediction
Build, train and test a machine learning model to predict insurance cost based on customer features such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of children, smoking habits, and geo-location. 

INSIGHTS:
-- Target(output) is to determine the individual medical costs billed by health insurance

-- Trying to predict continuous output which in this case is the dollar amount

-- There is a positive correlation between age and charges incurred on bill

-- There is a positive correlation between BMI and charges incurred on bill

-- The inital regression accuracy was 69% of the variations of the output has been represented by variations of the input

-- The final regression accuracy 72% after training the artifical neural network

-- The model prediction was .75 therefore indicating a high correlation with the true values of the dataset

-- A heatmap showcased a correlation of 0.79 between smokers and charges
